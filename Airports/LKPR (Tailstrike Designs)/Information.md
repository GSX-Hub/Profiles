**IMPORANT**
**If you are choosing the GSX VDGS version, you need to disable the AS VDGS in the scenery, because it will not look good if you will not.**  
Rename the file "Community\Tailstrike Prague\tailstrikedesigns-airport-lkpr-prague\scenery\LKPR_VDGS\scenery\LKPR_aerosoft_VDGS_modellib.BGL" to "LKPR_aerosoft_VDGS_modellib.BGL.off"
**LKPR Live Variant**
LKPR Live edition of the GSX config is a special version for Fiideell's modification of Tailstrike Prague called LKPR Live. It will not work properly without it - [LKPR Live - Tailstrike edition for Microsoft Flight Simulator | MSFS](https://flightsim.to/file/50324/lkpr-live-tailstrike-edition)
It also still uses GSX VDGS, so the same modification in the note above is still required
**LKPR Live Update Notice**
If you are updating from version 13.3. or lesser, LKPR Live Version now has it's own .py file (lkpr-darriancze-lkprlive-py). In order for it to work properly, you need to delete the old one (lkpr-darriancze.py)


## Features:
- Custom vehicle placement on all stands
- Custom pushback routes
- Correct wingspan according to the LKPR AIP
- Tweaked alternate stands in order to be recognized by the GSX
- Custom stand groups and stand names
- Custom stop positions based on the airport documentation

## Intentional features
- Pushbacks on heavy stands without the aircraft pull, have the allowed engine start after the aircraft is in it's final position. This is according to the real airport procedures
- There are also some special pushback routes for larger aircraft on several heavy stands. This is according to the real airport procedures. You may use them on VATSIM / IVAO, just make sure to inform the ATC, if they will not give it to you themselves. For example, stand 22

## Known Issues
- Stands 21 and 21A are so close together that there is no way to configure the GSX so it correctly recognizes the user's stand. While being at stand 21, GSX will still recognize it as 21A. However, this shouldn't affect the handling in any way, so you can just ignore it.
- Jetways are not working on some alternate stands. This is an MSFS limitation which I cannot fix.
